%Lets get usefull vector sizes

%Algorithm from the lab 2 as given 
for i = 1:n
    for m = 1:M
        for k = 1:N
            %as it is said in the lab notes

            nu(:,m,k) = z(:,i) - zHat(:,m,k); % nu 2xMxN
            nu(2,m,k)=mod(nu(2,m,k)+pi,2*pi)-pi;%as it was specified
            fi(i,m,k) = (1/(2*pi*det(Q)^(1/2))*exp(-(1/2)*(nu(:,m,k)'/Q)*nu(:,m,k)));
        end
        %Associations are known so 
        Psi(i,m,:) = fi(i,m,known_associations(i));
    end
    % as in the 3.5 of the lab notes
    %as many outliers as observations made
    outlier(i)= mean(Psi(i,:)) <= Lambda_psi;
end
%we need to reshape, as Psi is now nxMx1 and we need it as 1xnxM
Psi=reshape(Psi,[1 n M]);
